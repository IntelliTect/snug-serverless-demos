## Serverless applications using Azure Functions and AWS Lambda

In this demo we discuss the concept of 'Serverless' architecture: what the concept really means, why it's useful, when to/not use it, and present a few examples of how to use it.

### Azure Functions:

Setup a serverless image processing queue using Azure Functions in combination with event streams and queues.

### AWS Lambda:

Create and deploy a serverless ASP.Net Core Web API using only the dotnet cli.
